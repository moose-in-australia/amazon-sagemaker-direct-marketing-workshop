    "Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed service that covers the entire machine learning workflow to label and prepare your data, choose an algorithm, train the model, tune and optimize it for deployment, make predictions, and take action. In this workshop, you will run through the process end-to-end to understand how SageMaker helps you develop models faster from concept to production.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of building models in Amazon SageMaker can be divided into four stages:\n",
    "1. **Ground Truth**: Label your data for supervised learning tasks. Set up data labeling jobs using public or private teams. Ground Truth takes care of dividing the data between the annotators and consolidating the results. \n",
    "1. **Notebook**: Use Jupyter notebooks to explore and process your data. This is your environment for experimentation. Notebooks run on fully managed EC2 servers.\n",
    "1. **Training**: Run training and hyperparameter tuning jobs at any scale. The underlying resources are automatically spun up as required, and automatically spun down when the job is finished. \n",
    "1. **Inference**: Deploy your model in the real world. Make it available 24/7 through inference endpoints, or process data in batches.\n",

    "Normally, you won't be able to use the data as-is for training machine learning models.

In addition, your data set will often contain incomplete data, duplicate data, inconsistent data, irrelevant data, or outliers. These problems will affect the performance of the model, so data cleaning is a crucial step in the machine learning process. Several common techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handling missing values: Some machine learning algorithms are capable of handling missing values, but most would rather not. Options include:\n",
    "    * Removing observations with missing values: This works well if only a very small fraction of observations have incomplete information.\n",
    "    * Removing features with missing values: This works well if there are a small number of features which have a large number of missing values.\n",
    "    * Imputing missing values: Entire books have been written on this topic, but common choices are replacing the missing value with the mode or mean of that column's non-missing values.\n",

    "* Oddly distributed data: Although for non-linear models like Gradient Boosted Trees, this has very limited implications, parametric models like regression can produce wildly inaccurate estimates when fed highly skewed data. In some cases, simply taking the natural log of the features is sufficient to produce more normally distributed data. In others, bucketing values into discrete ranges is helpful. These buckets can then be treated as categorical variables and included in the model when one hot encoded.\n",
    "* Handling more complicated data types: Mainpulating images, text, or data at varying grains is left for other notebook templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, one question to ask yourself is whether certain features will add value in your final use case. For example, if your goal is to deliver the best prediction, then will you have access to that data at the moment of prediction? Knowing it's raining is highly predictive for umbrella sales, but forecasting weather far enough out to plan inventory on umbrellas is probably just as difficult as forecasting umbrella sales without knowledge of the weather. So, including this in your model may give you a false sense of precision. Following this logic, let's remove the economic features and duration from our data as they would need to be forecasted with high precision to use as inputs in future predictions."

    "1. Many records have the value of \"999\" for pdays, number of days that passed by after a client was last contacted. It is very likely to be a magic number to represent that no contact was made before. Considering this, we can create a new column called \"no_previous_contact\", then grant it value of \"1\" when pdays is 999 and \"0\" otherwise.\n",
    "1. In the \"job\" column, there are categories that mean the customer is not working, e.g., \"student\", \"retire\", and \"unemployed\".

More information about this algorithm will be provided in the training and tuning section, but for data preparation it is important to know the input requirements of the algorithm. One of the data formats accepted by XGBoost is CSV (comma-separated value). The CSV should be structured such that the rows are observations, the first column is the target variable, and the remaining columns are the features. In addition, the CSV file should contain only numeric data and no header. For more details, [read the documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/xgboost.html#InputOutput-XGBoost) on the input and output format of XGBoost.

    "\n",
    "When building a model whose primary goal is to predict a target value on new data, it is important to understand overfitting. Supervised learning models are designed to minimize error between their predictions of the target value and actuals, in the data they are given. This last part is key, as frequently in their quest for greater accuracy, machine learning models bias themselves toward picking up on minor idiosyncrasies within the data they are shown. These idiosyncrasies then don't repeat themselves in subsequent data, meaning those predictions can actually be made less accurate, at the expense of more accurate predictions in the training phase.\n",

There are several different ways of operationalizing this, holdout validation, cross-validation, leave-one-out validation, etc. For our purposes, we'll simply randomly split the data into 3 uneven groups. The model will be trained on 70% of data, it will then be evaluated on 20% of data to give us an estimate of the accuracy we hope to have on \"new\" data, and 10% will be held back as a final testing dataset which will be used later on."

    "SageMaker automatic model tuning helps with automating the hyperparameter tuning process. It allows you to define a range for each hyperparameter, and SageMaker will automatically run multiple training jobs with different hyperparameter values, evaluating the results based on a predefined objective metric. Results from the previous tuning jobs are used to choose values for consecutive tuning jobs. You can set a tuning budget (maximum number of training jobs), to stop the tuning process. Often the tuning process is iterative and requires running multiple tuning jobs after analyzing the results to get the best objective metric.\n",

    "* The ranges of hyperparameters we want to tune\n",

We recommend you set the parallel jobs value to less than 10% of the total number of training jobs (we'll set it higher just for this example to keep it short).\n",
    "* The objective metric that will be used to evaluate training results, in this example, we select *validation:auc* to be the objective metric and the goal is to maximize the value throughout the hyperparameter tuning process. One thing to note is the objective metric has to be among the metrics that are emitted by the algorithm during training. In this example, the built-in XGBoost algorithm emits a bunch of metrics and *validation:auc* is one of them. If you bring your own algorithm to SageMaker, then you need to make sure that it emits the objective metric you select.\n",

    "* *min_child_weight*: Minimum sum of instance weight (hessian) needed in a child. If the tree partition step results in a leaf node with the sum of instance weight less than min_child_weight, the building process gives up further partitioning. In linear regression models, this simply corresponds to a minimum number of instances needed in each node. The larger the algorithm, the more conservative it is. \n",
